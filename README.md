# mern-skeleton
A MERN skeleton web application with basic user functions (e.g. create/edit profile, sign in, sign up, sign out etc.)

This web application is developed with the help of Full-Stack React Projects by Shama Hoque. It is a working progress and I intend to improve and modify the features as I learn more about the MERN stack technology.
